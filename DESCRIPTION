Title: Support preparation of journal articles from LyX/pdflatex output
Description: Utility functions to work with LyX text files, Illustrator
    figures, Scribus documents and final pdf output from pdflatex. Can extract
    and combine pages from PDF files that we use when turning a single pdflatex
    output file into the individual pages that many journals still want. Can
    also do a decent job of compressing pdflatex output using ghostscript.
    Finally has options to read and write bookmarks.
