Title: PDF manipulation utilities (wrapping pdftk and ghostscript)

    we use when turning a single pdflatex output file into the individual pages
    that many journals still want. Can also do a decent job of compressing
    pdflatex output using ghostscript. Finally has options to read and write
    bookmarks.
