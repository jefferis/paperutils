# paperutils

R package with utility functions to support preparation of journal articles

## Introduction
We use a toolchain consisting of

1. LyX + pdflatex
2. Bibdesk (or Jabref etc)
3. Adobe Illustrator
4. R

to prepare our journal articles for submission. This package contains functions that are useful for checking which files are currently linked in the master LyX document (e.g. to ensure they are gitified). It also contains functions to work with the output from pdflatex

## Installation
### R Dependencies
The package [scholar](https://github.com/jkeirstead/scholar) is necessary. 
However currently the CRAN version is 
misssing the ability to specify a number of publications to return for each
author, so that only 20 can be returned. Therefore it is recommended to install
the latest version (see Bleeding Edge below).

### System Dependencies
  * [pdftk](http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/)
  * ghostscript e.g. from [mactex](http://tug.org/mactex)
  * perl

### Released versions
    install.packages("paperutils",repos='http://jefferislab.org/R',type='source')

### Bleeding Edge
Straight from github with Hadley Wickham's [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package:

```r
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(c("jkeirstead/scholar", "jefferis/paperutils"))
```
