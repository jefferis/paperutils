Title: Support preparation of journal articles from LyX/pdflatex output
Description: Utility functions to work with LyX text files, Illustrator figures
    and final pdf output from pdflatex. Can extract and combine pages from PDF
    files that we use when turning a single pdflatex output file into the
    individual pages that many journals still want. Can also do a decent job of
    compressing pdflatex output using ghostscript. Finally has options to read
    and write bookmarks.
