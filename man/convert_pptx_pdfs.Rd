\description{
PowerPoint 2010 et al will convert any pdfs that have been dropped onto
slides into bitmap pngs. Unfortuantely they do this at 72 dpi, which is
typically much too low resolution. This function makes higher resolution
versions of the pngs. Note that it will not upgrade pngs that already meet
the requested resolution. If this means that no images at all are upgraded
then the output file will be identical to the input.
}
\details{
This function depends on having the
  \href{http://www.imagemagick.org/}{ImageMagick} \bold{convert} function in
  the path.
